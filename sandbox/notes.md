Notes:
* Not easy or maybe even possible to get video url (m3u8) with v2 of API
    * Assuming still possible with 1.1 so maybe get elevated access
* Wanted to montage videos from a feed for fun but holding on that 
* Will keep playing with tweepy and API in general

Cool links:
* Link with Twitter python wrappers, CLI tools, etc.
